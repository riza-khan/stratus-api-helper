# Stratus API Helper

## Purpose

Dealing with Stratus can be time consuming. This app helps reduce the amount of effort required for simple tasks like updating configuration tokens.

## Todo

1. Add some type of notification to show success/error states of Http request
2. Some sort of global state so moving from page to page doesn't cause the lose of data. For example, moving from configuration route to email-template route.
3. Better error handling where if there is a validation error, do not override current json object
